# United States Political Stance Website
Website to display the analysis of voting records to show where US Congress Members stand on major political issues.

The website is up! You can find it here: [Political Stance Tracker](https://political-stance-website-frontend.vercel.app/) 

## Website Version
This is an early version, the final, more polished version may look very different.

## How Much Data Was Run?
Currently, you can find data on legislators from the 113th congress to present day. However, some models will have less data then others, I'm currently working on updating all models with data from the 113th congress - now. 

## What Features Exist?
Right now, there are legislator profiles, congress charts and rankings, and LLM-powered analyses of voted bills.

### Legislators Page
Search through legislators and click on them to find out their partisan scores on the most popular political topics.

### Congress Data Page
Look through histograms of congress, comparing models, political categories, and chambers.
Also, under each histogram, you can find the most conservative and most liberal congressional members on each issue.

### Bill Analyses Page
Look through LLM-powered analyses of all the bills voted on in congress to find out the partisan and impact scores of each bill. Look at how different AI models can reach different conclusions when given the same bill.

## Future Plans?
Many improvements to both the UI and data are still in the works. New features are on the way and more data is ready to be analyzed. Any feedback is welcome, and all the code is available here!
